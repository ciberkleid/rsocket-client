# rsocket-client

This is an RSocket Java client implemented using [spring-boot-starter-rsocket](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-rsocket) that illustrates the four RSocket interaction models (fire and forget, request/reply, request stream, and request channel) over both TCP and WebSocket.

This demo works in tandem with [rsocket-server](https://github.com/ciberkleid/rsocket-server).
Please see the rsocket-server [README](https://github.com/ciberkleid/rsocket-server/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on running the demo.
